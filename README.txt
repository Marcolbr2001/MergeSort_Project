Description
This project contains two files. The files are structured as follows:

Files
"Project" - This folder contains the fully functional project, without the "finished converion" LED.

"Project_with_LED" - This folder contains the project with the LED that helps the user know when the conversion is finished. 
		However, it has a very small bug: sometimes just one number is not ordered properly.

"Jupyter.py" - This is the python file used to test both projects.

"MergeSort_DOC" - This file is a pdf document that describes the projects.

"MergeSort_PPT" - This file is a pdf document of the presentation.

***The 'Project_with_LED' file contains ip_repo code that is more readable and easier to understand, and it is completely similar to the other one.***
